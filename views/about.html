            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>
                Originally from Southern Oregon, Joy received a Bachelor of Arts from the tight-knit and dedicated department of Art at Linfield College (McMinnville, OR) in 2010. In 2012, she moved to Whitefish, Montana.

            <h2>A NOTE FROM THE ARTIST</h2>
            <p>Painting is a constant exploration. With innovation and creative play as my tools, I search for balance. Through an organic, yet chaotic line and a full palette, I find harmony.</p>
            <p>
                I enjoy working in series, creating multiple pieces simultaneously. I often maintain an underlying connection within each group ranging from subject matter, to color palette, to perspective, or texture. Working in groups of paintings permits me to fully investigate a concept while allowing the idea to expand and grow. As a series, that concept is the connective thread, yet individually, each piece stands boldly.
            </p>
            <p>
                At times I work within an abstract/non-concrete mentality, using fine lines, bold colors and transparent washes to articulate an idea. Other times I use a figurative/symbolic approach to communicate. Depending on the sentiment, setting, notion or mood, each painting determines itâ€™s own route.
